# Approach 2: Compare with Top-Left Neighbor

# Time: O(M * N)
# Space: O(1)

# Every element belongs to some diagonal, and it's previous element (if it exists) is it's top-left neighbor. Thus, for the square (r, c), we only need to check r == 0 OR c == 0 OR matrix[r-1][c-1] == matrix[r][c]

class Solution:
    def isToeplitzMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        return all(r == 0 or c == 0 or matrix[r-1][c-1] == val
                   for r, row in enumerate(matrix)
                   for c, val in enumerate(row))
